# Wiley Assembly Language Step By Step 3rd. Ed. by Jeff Duntemann

I chose this book because Jeff Duntemann can explain complex things
very simply for my brain. I'm reading this book because I want to be
a hacker. 

What kind of hacker? I don't know yet. Kernel hacking sounds
cool, maybe do something with embedded programming. Make robots that
can do mundane tasks like pour me a bowl of cereal because I am that
lazy. Whatever kind of hacker I become, I'm going to enjoy the journey,
and that journey starts with ASM and this book.
